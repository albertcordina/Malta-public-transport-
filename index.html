            <p>The first buses were imported to Malta in 1905 from England.</p>
            <p>In the 1920s, operation of buses on public transport routes was subject to open competition between
                operators. Since then, the tradition of showing pride in the vehicles has been maintained, through
                decoration and customisation of the buses.</p>
            <p>In the 1970s, bus operation was centralised under a worker cooperative, the Public Transport Association,
                however, the overall transport system was regulated under the Malta Transport Authority.</p>
            <p>In December 2003, in light of over 100 buses being scrapped, and replaced with a modern fleet of buses by
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arriva" target="_blank">Arriva</a> (a British multinational
                public transport company), then Malta Public Transport.</p>

            <p>Ferry services between Malta and Gozo were in operation by 1241. The service, known in Maltese as
                id-dghajsa tal-mghodija, literally, the boat of the passage is first recorded in 1241.</p>
            <p> However, a daily service for passengers was not set up until 1885, with a ferry called the Gleneagles.
                The fare only cost eight pence for a single ticket, or one shilling for a return, but passengers
                arriving in Gozo were also asked to pay an extra penny for a mass in return for their safe arrival.</p>
            <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gozo_Channel_Line" target="blank">Gozo Channel Company Limited</a>
                was formed to operate ferry services in 1979. The four ships of E. Zammit & Sons Ltd were taken over by
                the new company, and two more vessels were purchased later in the year.</p>
            <p>Hovermarines or catamarans were used for express services between Malta and Gozo from 1988 to 2002.</p>
